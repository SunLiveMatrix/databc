License Terms
All instances of the “Use Rights” in Customer’s volume licensing agreement refer to the terms identified in the “Use
Rights” section of each Product Entry. For each Product, this includes the Universal License Terms, applicable License
Model Terms and any Product-Specific License Terms in the Product Entry.
For Online Services, references to “Use Rights” in Customer’s volume licensing agreement refer to the OST. If a
software Product includes both software and online services, the online services will be governed by the terms in the
OST and all the software will be governed by these License Terms.
Universal License Terms
Universal License Terms apply to all software Products licensed through Microsoft Volume Licensing (except where
specifically noted in the License Model Terms and/or the Product-Specific License Terms).
1. Definitions
Terms used in the Product Terms but not defined in the Glossary will have the definition provided in Customer’s
volume licensing agreement.
2. Customer’s Use Rights
If Customer complies with its volume licensing agreement, it may use the software as expressly permitted in the
Product Terms. Customer needs a License for each Product and separately licensed functionality used on a device or
by a user.
3. Rights to Use Other Versions and Lower Editions
For any permitted copy or Instance, Customer may create, store, install, run or access in place of the version licensed,
a copy or Instance of a prior version, different permitted language version, different available platform version (for
example, 32 bit or 64 bit) or a permitted lower edition. The use rights for the licensed version still apply. Licenses for
prior versions and lower editions do not satisfy the licensing requirements for a Product.
4. Third Party Software
The software may contain third party proprietary or open source programs or components that are licensed under
separate terms that are presented to Customer during installation or in the "ThirdPartyNotices" file accompanying the
software. The software may also contain third party open source programs that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses
to Customer under Microsoft’s license terms.
5. Pre-Release Code, Updates or Supplements, Additional Functionality
Microsoft may offer updates or supplements to the Products. Customer may use the updates or supplements to the
Products, pre-release code, additional functionality and optional add-on services to the Products, subject to specific
terms (if any) that accompany them. Some Products require automatic updates, as described in the Product-Specific
License Terms.
6. Restrictions
Customer may not (and is not licensed to) use the Products to offer commercial hosting services to third parties, work
around any technical limitations in the Products or restrictions in Product documentation, or separate the software for
use in more than one OSE under a single License (even if the OSEs are on the same physical hardware system), unless
expressly permitted by Microsoft. Rights to access the software on any device do not give Customer any right to
implement Microsoft patents or other Microsoft intellectual property in the device itself or in any other software or
devices.
7. Software Assurance
SA coverage may grant additional use rights to Customer. These additional rights end at the expiration of the SA
coverage for the License, unless otherwise noted in the benefit description.
8. Outsourcing Software Management
Customer may install and use licensed copies of the software on Servers and other devices that are under the day-to-
day management and control of Authorized Outsourcers, provided all such Servers and other devices are and remain
fully dedicated to Customer’s use. Customer is responsible for all of the obligations under its volume licensing
agreement regardless of the physical location of the hardware upon which the software is used. Except as expressly
permitted here or elsewhere in these Product Terms, Customer is not permitted to install or use licensed copies of the
software on Servers and other devices that are under the management or control of a third party.

9. License Assignment and Reassignment
Before Customer uses software under a License, it must assign that License to a device or user, as appropriate.
Customer may reassign a License to another device or user, but not less than 90 days since the last reassignment of
that same License, unless the reassignment is due to (i) permanent hardware failure or loss, (ii) termination of the
user’s employment or contract or (iii) temporary reallocation of CALs, Client Management Licenses and user or device
SLs to cover a user’s absence or the unavailability of a device that is out of service. Customer must remove the
software or block access from the former device or to the former user. SA coverage and any Licenses that are granted
or acquired in connection with SA coverage may be reassigned only with the underlying qualifying License. Additional
terms apply to the reassignment of Windows desktop operating system per device licenses, as detailed in the Windows
Product Entry.
10. Technical Measures
Microsoft may use technical measures to enforce terms that restrict Customer’s use of certain versions of Product and
may verify compliance with those terms as provided in Customer’s volume license agreement. Some Products are
protected by technological measures and require activation or validation, as well as a product key, to install or access
them.
10.1 Activation and validation
Customer shall use the appropriate product key provided by Microsoft for activation and validation of the software
Product being installed by the Customer. Customer’s right to use the software after the time specified in the
software Product may be limited unless it is activated. Customer is not licensed to continue using the software if it
has unsuccessfully attempted to activate. Each device that has not activated by a Key Management Service (KMS)
must use a Multiple Activation Key (MAK) or Azure AD-based Activation. Customer may not circumvent activation
or validation.
10.2 Product Keys
An assigned product key is required for licensed use of the software. All product keys are Confidential Information
of Microsoft. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Customer’s volume licensing agreement, Customer may
not disclose product keys to third parties. Customer may not provide unsecured access to its key management
service (KMS) machines over an uncontrolled network. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of product
keys or KMS keys, Microsoft may prevent further activations, deactivate or block product keys from activation or
validation, and take other appropriate action.
11. Notices
Where indicated in the Use Rights section of each Product Entry, the following notices apply:
11.1 Internet-based Features
Software Products may contain features that connect and send information over the Internet, without additional
notice to Customer, to Microsoft’s systems and those of its Affiliates and service providers. Use of that information
is described in the Microsoft Privacy Statement (aka.ms/privacy).
11.2 Bing Maps
The Product may include use of Bing Maps. Any content provided through Bing Maps, including geocodes, can only
be used within the product through which the content is provided. Customer’s use of Bing Maps is governed by the
Bing Maps End User Terms of Use available at http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9710837 and the Microsoft Privacy
Statement available at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248686.
11.3 H.264/AVC Visual Standard, the VC-1 Video Standard, and the MPEG-4 Part 2 Visual Standard
This software may include H.264/AVC, VC-1, and MPEG-4 Part 2 visual compression technology. MPEG LA, L.L.C.
requires this notice: THIS PRODUCT IS LICENSED UNDER THE AVC, THE VC-1, THE MPEG-4 PART 2 VISUAL PATENT
PORTFOLIO LICENSES FOR THE PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE OF A CONSUMER TO (i) ENCODE VIDEO IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE ABOVE (“VIDEO STANDARDS”) AND/OR (ii) DECODE AVC, VC-1, MPEG-4 PART 2 VIDEO

OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER LICENSED TO PROVIDE SUCH VIDEO. NO LICENSE IS GRANTED OR SHALL BE
IMPLIED FOR ANY OTHER USE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED FROM MPEG LA, L.L.C. SEE
www.mpegla.com. For clarification purposes, this notice does not limit or inhibit the use of the software for normal
business uses that are personal to that business which do not include (i) redistribution of the software to third
parties, or (ii) creation of content with the VIDEO STANDARDS compliant technologies for distribution to third
parties.
11.4 Malware protection
Microsoft cares about protecting customers’ devices from malware. The software will turn on malware protection if
other protection is not installed or has expired. To do so, other antimalware software will be disabled or may have
to be removed.

SQL Server 2019 CAL
3.2 Automatic Updates to Previous Versions of SQL Server
If the SQL Server software is installed on Servers or devices running any supported editions of SQL Server prior to SQL
Server 2012 (or components of any of them) this software will automatically update and replace certain files or
features within those editions with files from this software. This feature cannot be switched off. Removal of these files
may cause errors in the software and the original files may not be recoverable. By installing this software on a Server
or device that is running such editions you consent to these updates in all such editions and copies of SQL Server
(including components of any of them) running on that Server or device.
3.3 SQL Server Platform Selection
SQL Server Licenses are platform agnostic and permit deployment and use on Windows or Linux platforms.
3.4 Running Instances for Standard Edition
For each Server License, software may be run in only one Physical OSE or Virtual OSE at a time, but Customer may use
any number of Running Instances of the server software in that OSE.
3.5 SQL Server Big Data Nodes
Customer’s use of SQL Server Big Data Node is governed by the Use Rights for SQL Server Enterprise Core, except that
Customer may use SQL Server Big Data Node Instances only with a Master Node. A “Master Node” is an OSE running
SQL Server Standard Core or SQL Server Enterprise Core under Customer’s Licenses with SA or equivalent subscription
rights. The following SA rights also apply to Customer’s use of SQL Server Big Data Node: Unlimited Virtualization and
License Mobility.
3.6 Fail-Over Servers for Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW)
The PDW Appliance is a single unit made up of two or more compute nodes (Licensed Servers) all controlled by a
single PDW control virtual machine (Virtual OSE). Technology is built in to the appliance which allows the software to
fail-over to another compute node on the appliance. Customer does not need additional Licenses for the software
running in fail-over OSEs as executed by the PDW Appliance technology.
3.7 Use of SQL Server with Container Technology
For purposes of licensing use of SQL Server software running within a container on a container runtime such as docker,
cri-o, or containerd, (i) a container is considered to be a Virtual OSE, and (ii) the Physical or Virtual Cores available to
that container are considered to be Hardware Threads. Customer’s use is subject to the Per Core License Model or
Server/CAL License Model and any other License Terms relevant to the SQL Server Licenses Customer has
appropriately assigned to the Licensed Server in connection with that use. For clarity, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, if hyperthreading is enabled and Customer is licensing use under the Per Core License Model, Customer must
assign a Core License for each Hardware Thread mapped to a container, subject to a minimum of four Licenses.

4.1 SQL Server 2019 Enterprise Core - Unlimited Virtualization
Customer may run any number of instances of the server software in any number of OSEs on any Licensed Server for
which it has full SA coverage on all of its core licenses for the Server.
4.2 SQL Server – Fail-over Rights
For each of its Primary Workloads, Customer is entitled to:

One Fail-over OSE for any purpose, including high availability, on any Server dedicated to Customer’s use
(subject to the Outsourcing Software Management clause); and

Two Fail-over OSEs specifically for disaster recovery purposes:

one on any Server dedicated to Customer’s use (subject to the Outsourcing Software Management clause)
and

one on Microsoft Azure servers
Customer may also run Primary Workloads and its disaster recovery Fail-over OSEs simultaneously for brief periods of
disaster recovery testing every 90 days, and around the time of a disaster, for a brief period, to assist in the transfer
between them. Customer may perform the following maintenance-related operations for any permitted Fail-over OSE:

Database consistency checks or Checkdb

Log Back-ups

Full Back-ups

Monitoring resource usage data
Fail-over OSEs permitted for disaster recovery must be asynchronous and manual. Fail-over OSEs may not serve SQL
Server data to users or devices or otherwise run active SQL Server workloads. The number of licenses that otherwise
would be required for a Fail-over OSE must not exceed the number of licenses required for the corresponding Primary
Workload. These fail-over rights require SA for both the Licensed Server and CALs, if any, and do not apply when
Customer deploys SQL Software under License Mobility through SA.
4.3 Additional Fail-over OSE for High Availability for use with Big Data Clusters
Customer is entitled to one additional Fail-over OSE for high availability for each of its Primary Workloads that runs on
the Linux platform and serves as the SQL Server master instance when used in conjunction with Customer’s use of Big
Data Clusters. These additional Fail-over OSEs are otherwise subject to the same SQL Server – Fail Over Rights
limitations.
4.4 Use of SQL on Microsoft Azure
When using SQL Server on Azure under Azure Hybrid Benefit rights, or Disaster Recovery Rights, Customer should
indicate such use, as prompted in the Azure portal or Azure command line APIs.
4.5 SQL Server Big Data Nodes License Grant for SQL Server SA Customers
Customer will have eight SQL Server Big Data Node Licenses for each SQL Server Enterprise Core License with SA or
equivalent subscription rights assigned to one of its Master Nodes.
Customer will have one SQL Server Big Data Node License for each SQL Server Standard Core License with SA or
equivalent subscription rights assigned to one of its Master Nodes.
Customer may order additional quantities of SQL Server Big Data Node Licenses as needed.
4.6 SQL Server Enterprise Core and SQL Server Enterprise - Machine Learning Server for Windows and
Machine Learning Server for Linux
Only customers with servers licensed to run SQL Server Enterprise Core with SA or SQL Server Enterprise with SA may
use updates to Machine Learning Server for Windows and Machine Learning Server for Linux made available after
October 2017. Customers may use these updates on the Licensed Servers, subject to the SQL Server Enterprise Core
and SQL Server Enterprise use rights, respectively. Customers licensing SQL Server Enterprise under the Server/CAL
Licensing Model must also have SA on their corresponding CALs to obtain this benefit. Customers’ right to use these
updates expires when their SA expires.
4.7 SQL Enterprise Core – Running Machine Learning Server for Hadoop
For each SQL Server Enterprise Core License Customer has with active SA, Customer may also run Machine Learning
Server for Hadoop on up to five Servers dedicated to Customer’s use solely in conjunction with its licensed use of SQL
Server Enterprise Core. Any dedicated Server under the management or control of an entity other than Customer or
one of its Affiliates is subject to the Outsourcing Software Management clause.
4.8 Use of Power BI Report Server – SQL Server Enterprise Edition
Customer may run Power BI Report Server software on the Licensed Server or in Azure. Customer may run the
software on a maximum numbers of cores equal to the number of SQL Server Enterprise Edition Core Licenses with
active SA assigned to the licensed Server, subject to a minimum of four core licenses per OSE. Alternatively, if the
Table of
Contents

deploy Customer’s programs and databases that Customer develops with Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio
Enterprise. Utilities are designed for temporary use. Microsoft may not be able to patch or update Utilities separate
from the Visual Studio software, and some Utilities by their nature may make it possible for others to access devices
on which the Utilities are installed. Customer should delete all the Utilities installed onto a device when it finishes

limitations implemented in the software. If Microsoft technically limits or disables extensibility for the software,
Customer may not extend the software by, among other things, loading or injecting into the software any non-
Microsoft add-ins, macros, or packages; modifying the software registry settings; or adding features or
functionality equivalent to that found in the Visual Studio family of products.
3.3.2 No Degrading the Software.
If Customer develops an extension for Visual Studio Professional or Visual Studio Enterprise (or any other
component of the Visual Studio family of products), Customer must test the installation, uninstallation, and
operation of its extension to ensure that such processes do not disable any features or adversely affect the
functionality of Visual Studio Professional or Visual Studio Enterprise (or such component) or of any previous
version or edition thereof.

object code form of code marked as “sample”, “template”, “simple styles”, and “sketch styles”.

Third-party Distribution. Customer may permit distributors of its programs to copy and distribute the
Distributable Code as part of those programs.
3.5 Office Professional Plus 2019 – Visual Studio Enterprise Subscription
Each Licensed User of Visual Studio Enterprise Subscription may also install and use one copy of Office Professional
Plus 2019 or Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise for production use. Except as provided here, the Desktop Applications

the specified term. Customer will not be refunded payment (paid or scheduled) for unused Azure Reservations.
Notwithstanding the terms in Customer’s volume licensing agreement, fixed pricing does not apply to Azure
Reservations. Azure Reservation pricing will be based on the available pricing at the time of each purchase.
F. Azure Spot: Notwithstanding the terms in Customer’s volume licensing agreement, fixed pricing does not
apply to Azure Spot virtual machines. Azure Spot pricing is demand-based. The available pricing at the time of
each purchase is subject to change at any time. Customer can refer to the Azure portal for pricing
adjustments.
4. Pricing
Microsoft may offer lower prices to Customer (or Customer’s reseller) for individual Microsoft Azure Services during
Customer’s Enrollment term on a permanent or temporary (promotional) basis.
5. Payment and Fees
A. Using Azure prepayment: Each month, Microsoft will deduct from Customer’s Azure prepayment (or
Allocated Annual prepayment, if applicable) the monetary value of Customer’s usage of eligible Microsoft
Azure Services. Once Customer’s Azure prepayment (or Allocated Annual prepayment, if applicable) balance
has been exhausted, any additional usage will be invoiced at Consumption Rates (as described below).
B. Invoicing Azure prepayment: If Customer elects the Fully Prepaid Option, Azure prepayment will be
invoiced immediately. If Customers elects the Annually Prepaid Option, the first Allocated Annual prepayment
will be invoiced immediately, and future Allocated Annual prepayments will be invoiced on the anniversary of
the Enrollment effective date.
C. Invoicing Azure prepayment Overage: If Customer’s usage is higher than either its Azure prepayment
under the Fully Prepaid Option or its Allocated Annual prepayment under the Annually Prepaid Option, such
excess will be invoiced at Consumption Rates to Customer (or its reseller) at the end of each Enrollment
month.
D. Consumption Invoicing: If Customer provisions Microsoft Azure Services without a Azure prepayment, it (or
its reseller) will be invoiced monthly at Consumption Rates. All usage of the Microsoft Azure Services after the
expiration or termination of Customer’s subscription term will be invoiced to Customer (or its reseller) at then-
current Consumption Rates on a monthly basis.
E. Azure Services Plan Invoice: The purchase of a Microsoft Azure Services Plan will be invoiced to Customer
(or its reseller), either on an upfront or annual basis, according to the terms of Customer’s volume licensing
agreement governing payment terms for the order of Online Services generally. Azure prepayment cannot be
applied to the purchase of a Microsoft Azure Services Plan; provided, however, that if a Microsoft Azure
Services Plan includes the purchase of an initial quantity of a service (“Initial Quantity”), Customer usage that
exceeds the Initial Quantity will be billed at Consumption Rates, and Customer’s Azure prepayment can be
applied to such usage.
F. Azure Reservations: The purchase of Azure Reservations will be deducted automatically from any available
Azure prepayment. If Customer has used all of its Azure prepayment or if the cost of Azure Reservations
exceeds the available Azure prepayment balance at the time of purchase, the excess will be invoiced as
otherwise provided in this “Payment and Fees” section. Azure Reservations Customer purchases via Azure.com
will be charged against its credit card on file for the full upfront payment, or the charge will appear on its next
invoice. Azure Reserved Instances for a virtual machine or Azure SQL Database services cover compute only
(the base rate) and do not include the cost of the software (e.g., Windows Server or SQL Server), storage or
back-up. Conversely, Azure Reserved Instances for software do not include the cost of compute.
6. Azure Reservation Options
The following options apply to Azure Reservations Customer has purchased.

A.
Exchange: is an option that allows Customer to apply the monetary value of a remaining Azure Reservation
term to the purchase of one or more new Azure Reservations of equal or greater monetary value for the same
service.
B. Cancel: is an option that allows Customer to receive a prorated refund based on a remaining Azure
Reservation term minus an early termination fee (currently 12 percent) and subject to a cancellation limit set
by Microsoft (currently $50,000 per year).
C. Assignment: allows Customer to apply an Azure Reservation to a single (scoped) subscription of the
enrollments/account(shared).
7. Five Year Reservations for Azure VMs
As an exception to the general terms for Azure Reservations, we offer five year Azure Reservation terms for select VM
families. The early termination fee for a five-year Azure Reservation is 35%. Microsoft reserves the right during a five-
year Azure Reservation to move Customer to a newer version of the HB series for reasons including, but not limited to,
unavailability of parts for maintenance or lack of support from the hardware vendor. In such cases, the new version
and hardware configuration will provide at least the same level of performance.
8. Open License, Open Value and Open Value Subscription Programs
8.1 Definitions
Consumption Rates mean for purposes of the Open License, Open Value and Open Value Subscription
agreements, prices for all Microsoft Azure Services.
Portal means the online portal through which Customer administers its Subscription.
Subscription means a subscription with a value set at time of order that can be redeemed for a quantity of
Microsoft Azure Services.
8.2 Subscription Term
The Subscription period starts at the time of product key redemption and not the time of order. Once the product
key is redeemed, Microsoft will not accept return requests submitted by Microsoft’s partners. Subscriptions are
valid for the earlier of 12 months or until the value is consumed. Subscriptions may not be combined. Customer
may have multiple active Subscriptions. New Subscriptions can be purchased at any time.
9. Microsoft Azure Hybrid Benefit
9.1 Microsoft Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server
Under the Microsoft Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server, Customer may use Windows Server Virtual Machines
in Customer’s Microsoft Azure service accounts and pay for the cost of compute only (the “Base Instance”).
Customer must indicate that it is using Windows Server under the Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server when
creating or configuring a virtual machine on Azure. The Online Services Terms govern use of Windows Server
under this benefit. Customer may not concurrently allocate Windows Server Licenses to Azure Hybrid Benefit and
assign the same Licenses to its Licensed Servers, except on a one-time basis, for a period not to exceed 180 days,
to allow Customer to migrate the same workloads to Azure. On the earlier of completion of migration to Azure or
180 days from the start of migration, Licenses will be deemed “assigned to Azure”. Customer may later reassign
Licenses back to its Licensed Servers, provided Licenses remain assigned to Azure for a minimum of 90 days.
Except as provided below for Windows Server Datacenter Licenses allocated as described in “Unlimited
Virtualization Rights,” each Windows Server processor License with SA, and each set of 16 Windows Server core
Licenses with SA, entitles Customer to use Windows Server on Microsoft Azure on up to 16 Virtual Cores allocated
across two or fewer Azure Base Instances. Each additional set of 8 core Licenses with SA entitles use on up to 8
Virtual Cores on one Base Instance. Customer may use Standard or Datacenter software.
9.1.1 Special Use Rights for Windows Server Datacenter Licenses
As exceptions to the general terms governing allocation of licenses and use of Windows Server under the
Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server:

Unlimited Virtualization Rights. Customer may use Windows Server in any number of Base
Instances on an Azure Dedicated Host or other dedicated physical host in Azure, provided Customer
allocates Windows Server Datacenter Licenses with SA for all of the Physical Cores available to
Customer on that host. Concurrent use on Azure Dedicated Host or other dedicated physical host in
Azure and Customer’s Licensed Servers is limited to the same 180 day migration period.

Dual Use Rights. When exercised in connection with Datacenter Licenses with SA, the Azure Hybrid
Benefit for Windows Server provides rights to simultaneously deploy and use the software on Azure
and on Licensed Servers in Customer’s data centers. Dual use rights do not apply in the case of
Licenses allocated as described in “Unlimited Virtualization Rights.”
9.2 Microsoft Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server
Under the Microsoft Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server, for each SQL Server License covered with SA (“Qualified
License”), Customer may consume in its Microsoft Azure services accounts the Microsoft Azure Data Services
identified in the table below in the indicated ratios. If a customer wishes to use Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server
to consume two or more Microsoft Azure Data Services, one or more Licenses must be allocated for each service.

With Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server, customers will not be charged for the usage of a Microsoft Azure Data
Service, but they must still pay for the cost of compute (i.e., the base rate), storage, and back-up, as well as I/O
associated with their use of the services (as applicable). Customers must indicate that they are using Azure SQL
Database (Elastic Pool, and Single Database), Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure Data Factory SQL Server
Integration Services, or SQL Server Virtual Machines under Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server when configuring
workloads on Azure. Customers may supplement workloads running under Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server
with fully metered Azure services.
Customer may not concurrently allocate a License to Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server and assign the same
License to (a) shared servers under License Mobility through Software Assurance or (b) a Licensed Server, except
on a one-time basis, for a period not to exceed 180 days, to allow Customer to migrate those workloads to Azure.
On the earlier of completion of migration to Azure or 180 days from the start of migration, Licenses will be deemed
“assigned to Azure”. Customer may later reassign Licenses back to its Licensed Servers or to shared servers under
License Mobility through Software Assurance, provided Licenses remain assigned to Azure for a minimum of 90
days.
9.2.1 SQL Server Fail-over Rights
When allocating SQL Server Licenses for use with a SQL Server Virtual Machine under the Azure Hybrid Benefit
for SQL Server, Customer is entitled to:

One Fail-over OSE for any purpose, including high availability; and

One Fail-over OSE specifically for disaster recovery purposes.
Customer may also run Primary Workload and its disaster recovery Fail-over OSE simultaneously for brief
periods of disaster recovery testing every 90 days, and around the time of a disaster, for a brief period, to
assist in the transfer between them. Customer may perform the following maintenance-related operations for
any permitted Fail-over OSE:

Database consistency checks or Checkdb

Log Back-ups

Full Back-ups

Monitoring resource usage data

Fail-over OSEs permitted for disaster recovery must be asynchronous and manual. The number of licenses that
otherwise would be required for a Fail-over OSE must not exceed the number of licenses required for the
corresponding Primary Workload. Fail-over OSEs may not serve SQL Server data to users or devices or
otherwise run active SQL Server workloads.
Customer is entitled to one additional Fail-over OSE for high availability for each of its Primary Workloads that
runs on the Linux platform and serves as the SQL Server master instance when used in conjunction with
Customer’s use of Big Data Clusters. These additional Fail-over OSEs are subject to the same SQL Server – Fail
Over Rights limitations.
9.2.2 SQL Server Enterprise Core Unlimited Virtualization Rights
As an exception to the general terms governing allocation of Licenses and use of SQL Server under the Azure
Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server, Customer may use SQL Server in any number of Virtual Machines on an Azure
Dedicated Host or other dedicated physical host in Azure in one of its Microsoft Azure Services accounts,
provided Customer allocates SQL Server Enterprise Core Licenses with SA for all of the Physical Cores available
to Customer on that Azure Dedicated host. Concurrent use on Azure Dedicated Host or other dedicated
physical host in Azure and Customer’s Licensed Servers is limited to the same 180 day migration period.

2.1 Version Upgrade Rights
Customers with Server Subscriptions for Azure may use new versions released during the subscription period subject
to the Use Rights in effect when those versions are released. Similarly, CAL and External Connector License
Subscriptions for Azure permit access to new versions of the corresponding software released during the subscription
period.
2.2 Deployment Options for Windows Server
2.2.1 Using the Software on Microsoft Azure
If Customer uses Windows Server Virtual Machines in Customer's Microsoft Azure Service accounts, Customer will
not be charged for the usage of Windows Server but it must still pay for the cost of compute (the “Base Instance”).
Customer must indicate that it is using Windows Server under the Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server when
creating or configuring a virtual machine on Azure. The Online Services Terms govern use of Windows Server on
Azure. Each set of 16 core licenses entitles Customer to use Windows Server on Microsoft Azure on up to 16 Virtual
Cores allocated across two or fewer Azure Base Instances. Each additional set of 8 core licenses entitles use on up
to 8 additional Virtual Cores on one Base Instance. During the term of its subscription, Customer may also use RDS
CAL Subscriptions for Azure with Windows Server in Customer's Microsoft Azure Service accounts to permit access
to RDS functionality or a graphical user interface hosted on Windows Server using RDS functionality or other
technology.
2.2.2 Using the Software on Customer’s Servers
Alternatively, Customer may use Windows Server on Customer’s Licensed Servers. Except as provided in the
“Moving Server Workloads to Azure” section, licenses may not be concurrently allocated to Azure. Windows Server
Standard Subscription Licenses, and Subscription CALs and External Connector Licenses provide the same rights
as other volume licensing Windows Server Standard core licenses, CALs and External Connector Licenses,
respectively, subject to the same terms and conditions as stated in “Use Rights” in the Windows Server product
entry of the most current version of the Product Terms. During the term of its subscription, Customer is
additionally granted rights equivalent to the rights provided to SA customers under Self-Hosting, Disaster
Recovery, and for Semi-Annual Channel releases (subject to availability). Use of the software is subject to the
same terms and conditions.
2.2.3 Moving Server Workloads to Azure
Customer may not concurrently allocate Subscription Licenses to Azure and Customer’s Licensed Servers, except
on a one-time basis, for a period not to exceed 180 days, to allow Customer to migrate workloads from Licensed
Servers to Azure. On the earlier of completion of migration to Azure or 180 days from the start of migration,
Licenses will be deemed “assigned to Azure”. Customer may later reassign Licenses back to its Licensed Servers,
provided Licenses remain assigned to Azure for a minimum of 90 days.
2.3 Deployment Options for SQL Server
2.3.1 Using the Software on Microsoft Azure
Customer may consume in its Microsoft Azure Service accounts the Microsoft Azure Data Services identified in the
table below in the indicated ratios. If a customer wishes to use Subscription Licenses to consume two or more
Microsoft Azure Data Services, a separate set of Licenses must be allocated for each service.

Customer will not be charged for the usage of a Microsoft Azure Data Service, but it must still pay for the cost of
compute (i.e., the base rate), storage, and back-up, as well as I/O associated with its use of the services (as
applicable). Customer must indicate that it is using Azure SQL Database (Elastic Pool and Single Database), Azure
SQL Managed Instance, Azure Data Factory SQL Server Integration Services, or SQL Server Virtual Machines under
Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server when configuring workloads on Azure. Customers may supplement these
workloads running with fully metered Azure services.
2.3.2 SQL Server Fail-over Rights
When allocating SQL Server Subscription Licenses for use with a SQL Server Virtual Machine on Azure, Customer is
entitled to:

One Fail-over OSE for any purpose, including high availability; and

One Fail-over OSE specifically for disaster recovery purposes.
Customer may also run Primary Workload and its disaster recovery Fail-over OSE simultaneously for brief periods
of disaster recovery testing every 90 days, and around the time of a disaster, for a brief period, to assist in the
transfer between them. Customer may perform the following maintenance-related operations for any permitted
Fail-over OSE:

Database consistency checks or Checkdb

Log Back-ups

Full Back-ups

Monitoring resource usage data
Fail-over OSEs permitted for disaster recovery must be asynchronous and manual. The number of licenses that
otherwise would be required for a Fail-over OSE must not exceed the number of licenses required for the
corresponding Primary Workload. Fail-over OSEs may not serve SQL Server data to users or devices or otherwise
run active SQL Server workloads.
Customer is entitled to one additional Fail-over OSE for high availability for each of its Primary Workloads that runs
on the Linux platform and serves as the SQL Server master instance when used in conjunction with Customer’s use
of Big Data Clusters. These additional Fail-over OSEs are subject to the same SQL Server – Fail Over Rights
limitations.
2.3.3 Using the Software on Customer’s Servers
Alternatively, Customer may use SQL Server on Customer’s Licensed Servers. In this case, SQL Server Standard
and SQL Server Enterprise Core Subscription Licenses provide the same rights as other volume licensing SQL
Server Standard and SQL Server Enterprise core licenses, respectively, subject to the same terms and conditions
as stated in “Use Rights” in the SQL Server product entry in the most current version of the Product Terms. During
the term of its subscription, Customer is additionally granted rights equivalent to the rights provided to SA
customers under Self-Hosting, Disaster Recovery, License Mobility across Server Farms, Fail-over Rights, and
Unlimited Virtualization* as well as rights to use Machine Learning Server for Windows*, Machine Learning Server
for Linux*, Machine Learning for Hadoop*, and Power BI Report Server*. Use of the software is subject to the same
terms and conditions.
*Subject to availability. Rights applicable for SQL Server Enterprise Core customers only.

2.3.4 Moving Server Workloads to Azure
Customer may not concurrently allocate Licenses for use on Azure and assign the same License to one of
Customer’s Licensed Servers, except on a one-time basis, for a period not to exceed 180 days, to allow Customer
to migrate those workloads to Azure. On the earlier of completion of migration to Azure or 180 days from the start
of migration, Licenses will be deemed “assigned to Azure”. Customer may later reassign Licenses back to its
Licensed Servers, provided Licenses remain assigned to Azure for a minimum of 90 days.
2.3.5 SQL Server Enterprise Core Unlimited Virtualization Rights
As an exception to the general terms governing allocation of Licenses and use of SQL Server under the Azure
Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server, Customer may use SQL Server in any number of Virtual Machines on an Azure
Dedicated Host Server or other dedicated physical host in Azure in one of its Microsoft Azure Service accounts,
provided Customer allocates SQL Server Enterprise Core Subscription Licenses for all of the Physical Cores
available to Customer on that Azure host. Concurrent use on Azure Dedicated Host or other dedicated physical
host in Azure and Customer’s Licensed Servers is limited to the same 180 day migration period.
2.4 SQL Server Big Data Nodes
Customer’s use of SQL Server Big Data Node is governed by the Use Rights for SQL Server Enterprise Core in the SQL
Server product entry, supplemented as follows. Customer may use SQL Big Data Node Instances only with a Master
Node. A “Master Node” is an OSE licensed by Customer to run SQL Server Standard Core or SQL Server Enterprise Core
under Licenses with SA or with equivalent subscription rights. The following SA rights additionally apply to Customer’s
use of SQL Server Big Data Nodes used on a Licensed Server: Unlimited Virtualization. As an alternative to deploying
the software on Licensed Servers, Customer may allocate Big Data Node Licenses to Microsoft Azure (one License per
vCPU and minimum of four Licenses per virtual machine) and run Big Data Node software on Azure virtual machines.

Appendix B – Software Assurance
Purchasing Software Assurance
There are three different levels of commitment Customer may select when purchasing SA, which may vary by
program. Customer can:
1. Commit to attaching SA on all platform products.
2. Commit to attaching SA on all purchases under a particular Product pool (Applications, Systems or Servers),
referred to as Software Assurance Membership (SAM).
3. Purchase SA on individual Products without making any commitment to expanding SA to other Products.
SA must be acquired at the time of acquiring the License or upon renewal of an existing SA term. Unless otherwise
stated, only licenses for the latest version of a Product are eligible for SA. In the case of a transfer of perpetual
Licenses, the transferee may acquire SA for such transferred Licenses within 30 days from the date of transfer and
provided that the transferor maintained active SA for the Licenses up until the date of transfer.
Customers may have the option to acquire SA for certain licenses purchased from the Retail channel (full packaged
product) or from an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), within 90 days from the date of purchase as described in
the table below. Under Open Value, this option applies only to non-Organization–wide/ Company-wide products. Under
Enterprise Agreements, it applies only to Additional Products. Customers who acquire SA for OEM or retail licenses
have the option of installing and using the Volume Licensing software for the current version at any time.

Customers who acquire Microsoft Office Professional 2016 or 2019 from an OEM may acquire SA for Microsoft Office
Standard in the Open License programs, Select and Select Plus programs, and non Company-wide under Open Value
within 90 days from the date of OEM purchase.
Customers who acquire SQL Server 2017 from an OEM prior to March 31, 2020 may acquire Software Assurance for
SQL Server within 90 days of the OEM purchase.
Enterprise Agreement customers who transitioned to an Online Service or who purchased a From SA subscription
License in lieu of renewing SA may reattach SA to a License at anniversary or renewal without purchasing a new
License. SA must be ordered for that License for the remainder of the enrollment term. SA coverage may not exceed
the quantity of perpetual Licenses for which SA was current at the time of any prior transition or renewal and may not
be reattached to transferred Licenses.
Table of Contents / Glossary / Index
Renewing Software Assurance
Renewing Coverage under the Same Agreement
Terms for renewing SA under the same program agreement by which it was initially ordered are contained Customer's
volume licensing agreements. Customers may renew SA without the need to simultaneously order a License as long as
the SA coverage has not expired. In addition, the following terms apply to specific programs as noted:
Open License
SA coverage ordered under an Open License authorization number ends upon expiration of that number. To renew,
Customer must submit a renewal order for SA within 90 days after their authorization number expiration date.
Enterprise Agreement
To renew SA coverage under the same enrollment under an Enterprise Agreement, Customer must sign a new
2011 or later Enterprise Enrollment and Agreement (if they have not already), and must submit a renewal order for
SA (as applicable) for 1) all Enterprise Products, Application Platform Products, Core Infrastructure Products and
Additional Products they wish to renew and 2) any Online Services, accounting for transitions (if applicable).
Enrollment for Application Platform
EAP customers who have previously deferred Licenses via SA prior L SKUs must buyout their Licenses before they
can renew SA.

Renewing Coverage from a Separate Agreement
Customer may renew SA for any Product if Customer has obtained a perpetual License and SA for that Product under a
previous agreement in the same Volume Licensing Program, provided that 1) Customer’s new agreement enrollment,
or order (for MPSA) must be effective no later than the day following the date of expiration of the previous agreement
or enrollment, and 2) the SA renewal order must be placed prior to the expiration of prior SA coverage, unless such
coverage is being renewed from an Open License Agreement. In that case, Customers have 90 days from the
expiration to place the order.
Customer may also renew SA from one Volume Licensing program into a different Volume Licensing Program. For
Enterprise Products originally purchased under a program with a company-wide coverage requirement, this exception
applies only if the customer is renewing SA into the MPSA or a program with a company-wide coverage requirement
for Enterprise Products. For Agreement versions 2008 and prior, as long as coverage is renewed within 30 days (90
days if renewing from Open License program), customers will be deemed to have SA coverage during any period of
time between when their expiring SA coverage lapsed and when the new coverage begins.
Renewing Software Assurance Coverage for Client Access Licenses (CALs) and Client Management
Licenses (MLs)
Transitioning between User and Device CALs: Customers renewing SA for CALs can switch between User and
Device. This transition does not change the CAL edition (i.e. Standard to Enterprise).
Transitioning between User and OSE Client MLs: Customers renewing SA for client MLs can switch between User
and OSE.

Migration License for Discontinued or End-of-Life Products
“Qualifying License,” as used here, refers to a License with SA coverage as of the date specified and for the Product
identified in the product entry referencing this section.
“Migration License,” as used here, refers to rights granted in the Product Entry referencing this section.
Unless stated otherwise in the Product Entry:

Customer may upgrade to and use software under a Migration License in place of software covered by the
Qualifying License. The Customer may not use software under both licenses simultaneously.

Migration Licenses are granted on 1:1 for each of Customer’s Qualifying Licenses.

If Customer acquired perpetual rights to use software under a Qualifying License, the rights to use software
acquired under the Migration License are likewise perpetual; otherwise, rights acquired under a Migration
License expire when the underlying Qualifying License expires.

Upon expiration of SA coverage on the Qualifying License, Customer may acquire SA for the same version and
edition of the Product covered by the Migration License, without the need to first acquire separate new
Licenses. This option does not apply to customers buying licenses under subscription programs (e.g.,
Enterprise Subscription Agreements or Open Value Subscription agreements).

Customer may not transfer Migration Licenses separately from Qualifying Licenses.

Subsequently acquired licenses for the same discontinued Product under the same enrollment term under an
Enterprise or Enterprise Subscription Agreement, Open Value Subscription or Enrollment for Education
Solutions, as part of Customer’s scheduled true-up process are also Qualifying Licenses for purposes of the
license grant. Coverage for Products under subscription agreements must be continuous.
Table of Contents / Glossary / Index
Software Assurance Benefits
Most SA Benefits are available across each Product Pool, as described in the table below. Active SA for any qualifying
Product qualifies Customer for the benefits shown in the table below. Some benefits are awarded based on Customer’s
SA spend on a given set of qualifying products within a pool. For these purposes, “SA spend” is not literally Customer’s
actual dollars spent, but is an approximation of what Customer has spent on SA coverage for those Products under its
Select or Enterprise Enrollment, Select Plus registration or Open agreement (For example, SA only purchases and the
SA component of L&SA purchases). For customers under subscription programs, it is an approximation of the total
dollars Customer has spent licensing those Products under its enrollment or agreement. Software Assurance
Membership (“SAM”) is required for some benefits. Customer’s access and rights to use their SA benefits, generally
expires upon expiration of their SA coverage, unless otherwise noted below or in the Product Entries. The benefits are
subject to change and may be discontinued at any time without notice. Availability of benefits varies by program,
region, fulfillment options and language.

Calculating Software Assurance Benefits Points
Entitlements are calculated on a points-based system for 24x7 Problem Resolution Support (Phone) in MPSA.
Software Assurance Benefits points for 24x7 Problem Resolution Support (Phone) in MPSA are calculated based on the
number of qualifying licenses, applicable pools, and the points associated with qualifying products as listed in the
following table. Points cannot be combined across agreements, enrollments, or Purchasing Accounts to qualify for
additional points. Reduction of points as a result of returns and other billing adjustments, where allowed, may result in
the loss of entitlements during the present or future entitlement periods.

Microsoft will not be obligated to provide additional support services for that implementation.
An assisted break-fix support request, also known as an incident, is defined as a single support issue and the
reasonable effort needed to resolve it. A single support issue is a problem that cannot be broken down into
subordinate issues. If a problem consists of subordinate issues, each shall be considered a separate incident. In
certain situations, Microsoft may provide a modification to the commercially available Microsoft Product software code
to address specific critical problems (“Hotfix(es)”) in response to an assisted break-fix support request. Hotfixes are
designed to address Customer's specific problems and are not regression tested.
Phone Support Incident Awards for all programs except MPSA
The number of permitted phone support incidents varies by customer based upon their SA spend and payment
option. SA-spend-based incidents are earned based on server and desktop SA spend under a qualifying Select or
Enterprise enrollment, Select Plus registration, Open Value Agreement or Open License Authorization number.
Microsoft will award one incident for each Server SA or CAL SA spend of at least $20,000. Microsoft will award one
incident for each Systems Pool or Applications Pool SA spend of at least $200,000. The table below shows the
approximate currency equivalents for SA-spend-based awards for agreements based in currencies other than USD.

international support centers. After-hours phone support can only be used to initiate business critical support
requests. Business hours are determined on a region-by-region basis. Phone support assistance is not available in
all languages in all regions.
Web-Based Incidents
Customers (other than Academic Select License, Select Plus for Academic, Academic Open License, Campus and
School Agreement, Open Value Subscription – Education Solutions, and Open License) with Standard, Enterprise
and Datacenter Editions of server software covered with SA have access to electronic web-based Problem
Resolution Support services on an as needed basis. Access to the electronic support sites is available 24 hours per
day, 7 days a week, though responses will occur during Business Hours. Incidents initiated via the Web then
converted to phone resolution by Customer will count against the available phone incident balance upon
resolution. Incidents initiated via the Web then followed up via phone by Microsoft will not count against the
available phone incident balance if resolution continues on Web, email and other electronic means.
SA is required for both server software and related CALs for Web Support incidents. Customers may only submit
web-based Problem Resolution Support requests on those licensed copies of server software covered with SA.
Support Contacts
The number of permitted support contacts varies by Volume Licensing program and number of licenses covered
under SA, as shown below. Contacts must be named individuals and can include individuals from outside
Customer’s organization. However, an organization, department or group name may not be listed as a contact.

Conversion of Software Assurance 24x7 Problem Resolution Support Incidents to Premier Support
Services
With the exception of MPSA, Customers may convert SA 24x7 Problem Resolution Support Incidents (SA PRS
Incidents, or “SAB”) to Unified Support, Premier Problem Resolution Support (PRS) hours or Dedicated Support
Engineer (DSE) hours (applicable for reactive support activities only).
These services are for use consistent with their Premier Service or Unified Support plan at the time of transfer. The
conversion is based on a local rate calculation that will be provided by their Premier Account Team. Customers
may be required to purchase additional Support Account Management hours before converting SA PRS incidents.
SA PRS incidents that are converted to Premier are considered Premier Problem Resolution Support hours and are
subject to the Premier Services Description. Once converted, incidents cannot be returned to Customer’s SA
allowance.

Additional Business Provisions
SA spend may not be combined across Select or Enterprise enrollments, Select Plus registrations, Purchasing
Accounts, or Open Value Agreements to qualify for additional awards. Spending within each enrollment,
agreement, or Purchasing Accounts will be used to determine the award for that enrollment, agreement, or
Purchasing Accounts.
Reduction of SA Spend as a result of returns and other billing adjustments, where allowed, may result in the loss of
Support eligibility or Phone incident awards during the present or future award periods.
SCE Eligibility
Customers who have an SCE with a minimum annual average SA spend of $250,000 on total of qualifying products
in either the Application Platform or the CIS Suite and who have an active Premier Services Agreement are eligible
for Unlimited 24x7 Problem Resolution Support (PRS) incidents. The two eligible SCE components qualify
separately for Unlimited 24x7 Problem Resolution Support. Products listed below, that are currently in Mainstream
or Extended Support as set forth in Microsoft's Support Lifecycle Policy in line with a Customer’s Premier contract,
are included in this benefit.
The qualifying Application Platform Products are:

SQL Server (Standard, Standard Core, Enterprise Core, Business Intelligence and Parallel Data Warehouse
and CALs)

BizTalk Server (Standard, Enterprise, and Branch)

Office SharePoint Server
The qualifying products from the Core Infrastructure Component are:

CIS Suite Datacenter (Windows Server Datacenter and System Center Datacenter)

CIS Suite Standard (Windows Server Standard and System Center Standard)

When committed annual average SA spend on qualifying Application Platform and/or Core Infrastructure products
eligible for Unlimited 24x7 PRS is higher than $250,000, Microsoft will not award incidents based on actual SA
spend on these products. If Customer becomes eligible for Unlimited 24x7 PRS midstream, any incident previously
awarded based on SA spend and not consumed will be subtracted from Customer’s balance. Unlimited 24x7 PRS
incidents cannot be converted to Premier Problem Resolution Support hours or incidents.
Parallel Data Warehouse Eligibility
Customers who acquire licenses for SQL Server Enterprise Edition, deploy Parallel Data Warehouse (“PDW”) and
have an active Premier Services Agreement are eligible for Unlimited 24x7 PRS incidents, regardless of being
enrolled in an SCE or their SCE spend.
While all qualifying customers will receive an unlimited number of 24x7 PRS incidents, the number of permitted
support contacts to manage Unlimited 24x7 PRS does vary by size of the SA spend. All eligible customers are
entitled to at least four authorized contacts plus one additional contact per every additional $125,000 of SA spend
under their SCE or VL program (s) under which they purchased licenses for SQL Server Enterprise Edition, deploy
PDW. For agreements in foreign currencies, eligible customers are entitled to at least four authorized contacts plus
one additional contact for each incremental SA spend amount equivalent to $125,000 of annual average SA spend
in the applicable foreign currency. See table below:

Premier Services Agreement.
Note: Customers currently licensed for PDW maintain this benefit as detailed in the June 2016 Product Terms.
Step-Up License Availability
The Step-Up License must be acquired, and is valid only when acquired, under the same volume licensing agreement
and enrollment (if any), under which SA coverage for the qualifying product was acquired. Customer’s right to the use
of software under a Step-Up License is conditioned on their having and retaining a License for the qualifying product.
Customers’ perpetual rights under the Step-Up License supersede and replace the underlying License for the qualifying
product.

Servers – Disaster Recovery Rights
For each Instance of eligible server software Customer runs in a Physical OSE or Virtual OSE on a Licensed Server, it
may temporarily run a backup Instance in a Physical OSE or Virtual OSE on either, another one of its Servers dedicated
to disaster recovery, or, for Instances of eligible software other than Windows Server, on Microsoft Azure Services,
provided the backup Instance is managed by Azure Site Recovery to Azure. The License Terms for the software and
the following limitations apply to Customer’s use of the backup Instance. Any dedicated Server used for these
purposes, that is under the management or control of an entity other than Customer or one of its Affiliates, is subject
to the Outsourcing Software Management clause.
Permitted Use of Backup Instances
The backup Instance can run only during the following exception periods:

For brief periods of disaster recovery testing within one week every 90 days;

During a disaster, while the production Server being recovered is down; and

Around the time of a disaster, for a brief period, to assist in the transfer between the primary
production server and the disaster recovery Server.
Using the Azure Hybrid Benefit for Disaster Recovery
Customer optionally may use Windows Server under the Azure Hybrid Benefit for backup Instances run and
managed on Microsoft Azure Services using Azure Site Recovery. In this case, notwithstanding anything to the
Table of
Contents

License
Terms

Services
Glossary

IndexMicrosoft Volume Licensing Product Terms (Worldwide English, February 2021)
106
contrary in the Microsoft Azure License Terms governing Azure Hybrid Benefit, Customer will be permitted to
concurrently deploy the same Windows Server Standard Licenses on Microsoft Azure Services under Azure
Hybrid Benefit for purposes of testing and during recovery (as described in “Permitted Use of Backup
Instances” above) and on the Licensed Servers running the corresponding production workloads. Furthermore,
Customer may resume running the same production workloads on the Licensed Servers as contemplated in
this Disaster Recovery Rights provision, notwithstanding any limitations on License reassignment.
Requirements for Disaster Recovery Use
In order to use the software under disaster recovery rights, Customer must comply with the following terms:

The OSE on the disaster recovery Server must not be running at any other times except as above.

The OSE on the disaster recovery Server may not be in the same cluster as the production Server.

Use of the software backup Instance should comply with the License Terms for the software.

Once the disaster recovery process is complete and the production Server is recovered, the backup
Instance must not be running at any other times except those times allowed here.

Maintain SA coverage for all CALs, External Connector licenses and Server Management Licenses
under which it accesses the backup instance and manage the OSEs in which that software runs.

Customer’s right to run the backup Instances ends when Customer’s Software Assurance coverage
ends.
Additional Permitted Use of Windows Server

Other than backup instances run on Microsoft Azure Services, Windows Server License is not required
for the disaster recovery Server if the following conditions are met:

The Hyper-V role within Windows Server is used to replicate Virtual OSEs from the production
Server at a primary site to a disaster recovery Server.

The disaster recovery Server may be used only to
- run hardware virtualization software, such as Hyper-V,
- provide hardware virtualization services,
- run software agents to manage the hardware virtualization software,
- serve as a destination for replication,
- receive replicated Virtual OSEs, test failover,
- await failover of the Virtual OSEs, and
- run disaster recovery workloads as described above.

The disaster recovery Server may not be used as a production Server.
License Mobility
License Mobility Across Server Farms
Under License Mobility Across Server Farms, Customer may reassign any of its Licenses which are designated as
having License Mobility and for which it has SA to any of its Licensed Servers located within the same Server Farm
as often as needed. Customer may also reassign these Licenses from one Server Farm to another, but not on a
short-term basis (i.e., not within 90 days of the last assignment). Products used for Self-Hosting may be used at
the same time under License Mobility Across Server Farms rights.
License Mobility through Software Assurance
Under License Mobility Through Software Assurance (SA), Customer may move its licensed software to shared
servers under any of its Licenses which are designated as having License Mobility for which it has SA, subject to
the requirements below. Products used for Self-Hosting may be used at the same time under License Mobility
through SA rights, subject to the limitations of the Self-Hosting License Terms.
Permitted Use:
With License Mobility through SA, Customer may:

Run its licensed software on shared servers;

Access that software under access licenses and for which it has SA, and under its User and Device SLs
that permit access to the Products;

Manage its OSEs that it uses on shared servers; and/or

Manage its OSEs that it uses on its servers using software that it runs on shared servers.
Requirements:
To use License Mobility through SA, Customer must:

Run its licensed software and manage its OSEs on shared servers under the terms of its volume
licensing agreement;

Deploy its Licenses only with Microsoft Azure Services or qualified License Mobility through Software
Assurance Partner; and

Complete and submit the License Mobility verification form with each License Mobility through
Software Assurance Partner who will run its licensed software on their shared servers.

Customer may move its licensed software from shared servers back to its Licensed Servers or to another
party’s shared servers, but not on a short term basis (not within 90 days of the last assignment). Customer
may also move Instances run or OSEs managed under a particular License from shared servers in one Server
Farm to its shared servers in another Server Farm, but not on a short-term basis (not within 90 days of the last
assignment). OSEs managed under the same License must be in the same Server Farm. Customer agrees that
it will be responsible for third parties’ actions with regard to software deployed and managed on its behalf.
Except as provided below, the License Terms applicable to the Product together with the License Mobility
through SA terms govern its use. The License Mobility through SA terms supersede any conflicting License
terms for a Product when License Mobility through SA is used. License Mobility through SA rights also apply to
Listed Providers’ Servers that are dedicated to Customer’s use, subject to these same terms and conditions.

Fail-over Rights
For SQL Server Instances run under License Mobility through SA rights, Customer may run passive fail-over
Instances in one OSE on the qualifying shared servers in anticipation of a fail-over event. The number of
licenses that otherwise would be required to run the passive fail-over Instances must not exceed the number
of licenses required to run the corresponding production Instances on the same partner’s shared servers.
Servers – Self Hosted Applications
Self-Hosted Applications means those Products for which Self-Hosted rights apply.
Despite any terms to the contrary in Customer’s volume licensing agreement including the Product Terms, Customer
may run licensed copies of Self-Hosted Applications that interact directly or indirectly with its software to create a
unified solution (“Unified Solution”) and permit third parties to use it, subject to the terms below.
Requirements
Customer must have the required Microsoft Licenses and SA for:

the Self-Hosted Applications run as part of the Unified Solution; and

all access Licenses used to make the Unified Solution available to External Users.
All Microsoft software used to create and deliver the Unified Solution must be:

licensed through a Volume Licensing program; and

eligible for Self Hosting under these License Terms.
Customer may use Self-Hosted Applications in conjunction with License Mobility through Software Assurance rights
to deliver the Unified Solution from shared servers. Because there is no License Mobility for Windows Server,
Customer may not use Windows Server (nor Remote Desktop Services External Connector License or any other
Windows Server access license) as a Self-Hosted Application on shared servers. Instead, Customer must use
Windows Server software licensed through a License Mobility through Software Assurance Partner or Customer’s
Services Provider Licensing Agreement, or under another Microsoft Volume Licensing offering permitting use on
shared servers. Other Products used in a Unified Solution delivered from shared servers must have License
Mobility through Software Assurance. Any dedicated Server used for these purposes, that is under the
management or control of an entity other than Customer or one of its Affiliates, is subject to the Outsourcing
Software Management clause.

Customer’s software must:
1. add significant and primary functionality to the Self-Hosted Applications that are part of the Unified
Solution (dashboards, HTML editors, utilities, and similar technologies alone are not a primary service
and/or application of a Unified Solution);
2. be the principal service and/or application of the Unified Solution, and must not allow direct access to the
Self-Hosted Applications by any end user of the Unified Solution;
3. be delivered to end users over the Internet, a telephone network, or a private network from servers under
the day to day control of Customer or a third party other than the end user of the Unified Solution (the
Unified Solution may not be loaded onto the end user’s device); and
4. be owned, not licensed, by it, except that its software may include non-substantive third party software
that is embedded in, or operates in support of, its software.
All use of the Self-Hosted Applications remains governed by the License Terms for those products. Customer may
not transfer Licenses acquired under its volume licensing agreement except as permitted in that agreement.
Table of Contents / Glossary / Index
Extended Security Updates
Customer may purchase Extended Security Updates (“ESU”) coverage for Licenses with SA coverage and equivalent
Subscription Licenses.
License Requirements
ESU Coverage is required for each core or server License assigned to the Licensed Server, subject to the same license
minimums. ESU coverage is not required (nor available) for CALs or External Connector Licenses; however, Customer
must have active SA (or equivalent Subscription Licenses) for CALs and External Connector Licenses permitting access
to Servers with active ESU coverage.
Coverage Eligibility
For any given Server, Customer may acquire ESU coverage for years two and three of the offering only if Customer
also acquired coverage for the preceding year. ESU coverage is not required to be co-terminus with SA coverage or SA
equivalent Subscription Licenses; however, Customer must have a minimum of one month of qualifying SA coverage or
Subscription License term remaining at the beginning of the actual coverage period for each year of ESU coverage
purchased (i.e., during year one, year two or year three).
Use of Updated Software
Except as follows, server software that is updated through ESU coverage may be used only under licenses that have
ESU coverage.
i. Customer may continue to use updated software after coverage expires, but only under licenses to which
coverage applied.
ii. Customer may apply updates provided under their ESU coverage to software Customer licenses and uses
solely for development, test and related purposes under corresponding Developer edition licenses or Visual
Studio subscriptions.
iii. Customer may use updated software under licensed SQL Server, Windows Server, and Windows 7 workloads
running on Azure Stack Hub.
Covering Hosted Workloads
Customer may also purchase ESU coverage for workloads running on Authorized Services Providers’ servers under
License Included offerings. “Authorized Services Providers” means services providers listed at
http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/software-assurance/license-mobility.aspx. “License Included” means Customer is
licensing Windows Server or SQL Server through the Authorized Services Provider, and is not bringing its own licenses
(e.g., BYOL). Customer must acquire ESU licenses for all of the Virtual Cores in a Virtual OSE subject to a minimum of
16 for Windows Server and four for SQL Server.
Azure Stack Hub Workloads
Customer may have access to ESUs for its licensed SQL Server, Windows Server, and Window 7 workloads running on
Azure Stack Hub. The requirements to purchase ESU coverage and to access updated server workloads only under
CALs with SA coverage are waived solely with respect to SQL Server, Windows Server, and Windows 7 Instances
Customer is running on Azure Stack Hub.
24x7 Problem Resolution Support
During the term of ESU coverage, Customer will be eligible to apply available 24x7 Problem Resolution Support
incidents to the use of the covered version on its qualifying Servers. Qualifying Servers are Licensed Servers with
active SA and ESU coverage and Licensed Servers also licensed for and running Azure Stack Hub.

Appendix E – Program Agreement
Supplemental Terms
The terms and conditions below apply to Customer’s volume licensing agreement, as noted.
Supplemental Terms for Select Plus Program
Select Plus requires a minimum order quantity of 500 points per pool during the first year. This order quantity
requirement may be waived if a Qualified Contract is supplied.
Price Levels in Select Plus
Customer’s prices are based upon agreement between Customer and Customer’s reseller. However, Microsoft provides
reseller with the following price and point criteria to help guide reseller to end customer pricing:

Definition of Management for Qualified Devices
If Customer’s volume licensing agreement refers to the Product Terms, the Product List, or the PUR for defining
managed Qualified Devices, the following terms apply. Customer “manages” any device on which it directly or
indirectly controls one or more operating system environments. For example, Customer manages any device:

it allows to join its domain, or

it authenticates as a requirement to use applications while on its premises, or

it installs agents on (e.g., anti-virus, antimalware or other agents mandated by the Customer’s policy), or

to which it directly or indirectly applies and enforces group policies, or

on which it solicits or receives data about, and, configures, or gives instructions to hardware or software that is
directly or indirectly associated with an operating system environment, or

it allows to access a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) outside of Windows SA, Microsoft Intune (Device) or
Windows Virtual Desktop Access Roaming Rights.
A device that accesses a VDI under Roaming Rights only or utilizes Windows To Go on a Qualifying Third Party Device
off the Customer’s premises only, and is not managed for other purposes as described here, is not considered
“managed” for purposes of this definition.
Online Services in the Open Programs
Under the Open License, Open Value, and Open Value Subscription programs, the subscription period for Online
Services starts at the time of product key activation and not the time of order. Once the product key is activated,
Microsoft will not accept return requests submitted by Microsoft’s partners.
Customer qualifies for the Open Value program with a minimum purchase of 5 licenses. Online Services User
Subscription Licenses (User SLs) can be counted toward the minimum quantity of 5 licenses. However, 5 User SLs
alone does not meet the minimum for Open Value Organization Wide and Open Value Subscription. For OV
Organization Wide and OV Subscription the initial order must include a minimum of 5 Desktop Platform or Desktop
Component Licenses in addition to any User SLs.
Supplemental Terms for Professional Services – Legacy Agreements
Customer’s right to use of any consulting and support services Microsoft performs (“Professional Services”) purchased
from the Product Terms are governed by (1) customer’s volume licensing agreement, and (2) any master-level
Microsoft Services agreement customer may have in place at the time of purchase. In the event of a conflict, the most
current Professional Services agreement controls. If Customer’s master agreement for volume licensing is a Microsoft
Business Agreement version dated prior to September, 2007 or otherwise does not include terms for Professional
Services, and Customer has not signed any other master-level Microsoft Services agreement, the following
supplemental terms apply to any Professional Services purchased and used by Customer.
Use, Ownership, and License Rights
Fixes
If Microsoft provides Product Fixes, modifications or enhancements, or their derivatives, either released generally
(such as Product service packs) or to address a specific issue for Customer (collectively, “Fixes”), such Fixes are

IndexMicrosoft Volume Licensing Product Terms (Worldwide English, February 2021)
121
licensed under the same terms as the Product to which it applies. If the Fixes are not provided for a specific
product, any use terms Microsoft provides with the Fixes will apply
Pre-Existing Work
All rights in any computer code or non-code based written materials developed or otherwise obtained independent
of the Professional Services provided to Customer (“Pre-Existing Work”) shall remain the sole property of the party
providing it. Each party may use, reproduce and modify the other party’s Pre-Existing Work only as needed to
perform obligations related to Professional Services.
Except as may be otherwise expressly agreed by the parties in writing, upon payment in full Microsoft grants
Customer a non-exclusive, perpetual, fully paid-up license to use, reproduce and modify (if applicable) any
Microsoft Pre-existing Work provided as part of a Services Deliverable, solely in the form delivered to Customer,
and solely for Customer’s internal business purposes. The license to Microsoft’s Pre-Existing Work is conditioned
upon Customer’s compliance with the terms of Customer's volume licensing agreement.
Services Deliverables
Any computer code or materials other than Products or Fixes that Microsoft leaves with Customer at the conclusion
of Microsoft’s performance of Professional Services are considered Services Deliverables. Upon payment in full for
the Professional Services, Microsoft grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual license to
reproduce, use, and modify the Services Deliverables solely for Customer’s internal business purposes, subject to
the terms and conditions governing the Professional Services and Customer’s volume licensing agreement.
Use of technical information from Professional Services
Microsoft may use any technical information it derives from providing Professional Services for problem resolution,
troubleshooting, product functionality enhancements, in Fixes, and for Microsoft’s knowledge base. Microsoft
agrees not to identify Customer or disclose any of Customer’s Confidential Information as part of such use.
Open Source License Restrictions
Customer must not install or use non-Microsoft software or technology in any way that would subject Microsoft’s
intellectual property to obligations beyond those included in these Professional Services terms or Customer’s
volume licensing agreement.
Affiliates’ Rights
Customer may sublicense the rights to use Services Deliverables to its Affiliates, but Customer’s Affiliates may not
sub-license these rights. Customer is liable for ensuring its Affiliates’ compliance with these Professional Services
terms and Customer’s volume licensing agreement.
Warranties and Limitations of Liability
Warranty for Professional Services
Microsoft warrants that it will perform the Professional Services with professional care and skill. If Microsoft fails to
do so and Customer notifies Microsoft within 90 days of the date the Professional Services were performed, then
Microsoft will, as the sole remedy for the breach of the warranty, either re-perform the Professional Services or
return the price Customer paid for them. Except for the limited warranty above, Microsoft provides no
other warranties or conditions and disclaims any other express, implied or statutory warranties,
including warranties of quality, title, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose.
Limitation of Liability
Microsoft’s liability for direct damages will be limited to the amounts Customer was required to pay for the
Professional Services. In the case of services provided free of charge, or code Customer is authorized to
redistribute to third parties without separate payment to Microsoft, Microsoft’s liability is limited to direct damages
up to U.S. $5,000. In no event will either party be liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or
consequential damages, including loss of use, loss of profits, or interruption of business, however
caused or on any theory of liability in relation to the Professional Services. No limitation or exclusions
will apply to liability arising out of either party’s (1) confidentiality obligations; or (2) violation of the
other party’s intellectual property rights.

Azure Service Terms
These Ruggedized Azure Stack Hub Appliance Hardware Terms (“Additional Terms”) apply to Customer’s receipt
and use of the Appliance as part of the overall Service. Customer’s use of the Service is also subject to the Azure
Service Agreement and Terms located at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/, which includes without
limitation, the Customer’s customer or other license agreement and the Online Services Terms. These Additional
Terms supplement but do not amend or modify any existing terms in the Azure Service Agreement and Terms. If
there is a conflict between these Additional Terms and any of the terms comprising the Azure Service Agreement
and Terms, the Additional Terms will govern and control for purposes of the use of the Appliance as part of the
Service.
Limitations
Microsoft is not obligated to continue to make the Appliance or any other hardware product available in connection
with the Service. The Appliance may not be available in certain regions or jurisdictions, and even where it is, it is
subject to availability. Microsoft is not responsible for delays related to the Service that are outside of its direct
control. Microsoft reserves the right to refuse to offer the Service and corresponding Appliance to anyone in its
sole discretion and judgment. Microsoft may suspend the Service in its discretion in accordance with the terms for
Microsoft Azure services under the Microsoft Online Services Terms.
Use of the Appliance and Software
Conditions for Appliance Use
Subject to the payment of applicable fees, Microsoft grants Customer permission to use to the Appliance, provided
that Customer implements the following:
i. Data protection. Customer agrees to take certain precautions regarding its customer data: (i) Back up
and protect all data prior to copying to and storing on the Appliance ; (ii) do not delete the data from
Customer’s premises and equipment before Customer has successfully transferred such data from the
Appliance to Microsoft; and (iii) Apply updates as set forth herein and perform preventative maintenance
as recommended by Microsoft.
ii. Customer Determination of Appropriateness. Customer agrees (i) that it is solely responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using the Appliance as set forth in these Additional Terms, and (ii) that
Microsoft shall have no liability to Customer or any other third party for any loss of data or other damages.
iii. Deployment pre-requisites and facility assessment. Customer agrees to meet Microsoft’s
requirements necessary to support the installation, use, maintenance, and removal of the Appliance.
iv. No Transfer or Access. Customer agrees to not sell, assign, or transfer the Appliance, and will not
directly or indirectly (through a third party) view, open, modify, disassemble, or otherwise tamper with the
Appliance (including the Software).
Accreditation
To the extent that the Customer is a governmental entity, Microsoft also grants Customer the right to place the
Appliance through its accreditation processes to meet its needs, including without limitation, accreditation
requirements and processes for use in an unclassified, secret, or top secret domain.
Software
The Software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft grants Customer a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license to
use the Software with the Appliance, and for no other purpose. Microsoft reserves all other rights. This license
does not give Customer any right to, and Customer may not: (i) use or virtualize features of the Software

restrictions in the Software or restrictions in the Appliance documentation (if any); (iv) separate and run parts of
the Software on more than one device; (v) install or use non-Microsoft software or technology in any way that
would subject Microsoft’s intellectual property or technology to any other license terms; or (vi) reverse engineer,
decompile, or disassemble the Software, or attempt to do so, except if applicable law permit this even when these
terms do not and, in that case, Customer may do so only as the law allows. Subject to the foregoing limitations,
Customer’s use of the Software is subject to the software license terms presented to or otherwise made available
to Customer in connection with the Appliance, and also includes without limitation, any separate license terms for
any separate modules or agents to run additional Azure services on or in connection with the Appliance. If there is
a conflict between these Additional Terms and any separate license terms for any separate modules or agents
used in connection with the Appliance, the separate license terms for those modules or agents shall govern and
control for the use of such modules or agents.
Restrictions on Benchmarking
Customer may not use the Software for comparisons or “benchmarking,” except for Customer’s internal purposes,
nor publish or disclose the results thereof.
Activation/Consent for Internet-based Services
If activation of the Software is necessary, activation associates the use of the Software with a specific device.
During activation and subsequent use of the device, the Software may send information about the Software and
device to Microsoft, as described in the Documentation. Microsoft uses this telemetry to make the Internet-based
services available to Customer. By using the Appliance and Software, Customer consents to the transmission of
this information to Microsoft.
Software Updates
Microsoft may make Software updates available for the Appliance. If updates are made available, the updates from
Microsoft will be licensed by Microsoft and any third-party updates will be licensed by the applicable third party. In
order to continue to receive Appliance support, Customer agrees that it will stay current with applicable updates
by downloading and applying the most recent updates in compliance with Microsoft’s published or provided policy.
Delivery, Deployment, and Use of the Appliance
i. Delivery. The Service and the Appliance are offered as a Microsoft first party service under these Additional
Terms and the Azure Service Agreement and Terms, and by which Microsoft will deliver the Appliance to
Customer’s specified location (“Customer Specified Location”), subject to Service and Appliance availability.
ii. Deployment. Microsoft will initiate and complete the deployment of the Appliance at the Customer Specified
Location, which can typically take up to fifteen (15) days.
iii. Use. As part of the Service, Microsoft allows Customer to use the Appliance for as long as the Customer has
an active subscription to the Service, which use includes but is not limited to, use of the hardware, hardware
support, and basic software infrastructure services (e.g., storage, compute, including virtual machines and
containers). As part of the deployment and use of the Service and the Appliance, Customer agrees to provide
assigned resources at the level reasonably requested by Microsoft to address pre-requisite activities,
information, items for deployment, and ongoing management.
iv. Optional Services. Customer may use and subscribe to additional, optional services in connection with the
Service and Appliance that will be subject to a separate fee or subscription.
Title and Risk of Loss; Shipment and Return Responsibilities
Title and Risk of Loss
All right, title and interest in each Appliance is and shall remain the property of Microsoft, and except as expressly
set forth in these Additional Terms, no rights are granted to any Appliance (including under any patent, copyright,
trade secret, trademark or other proprietary rights). Customer will compensate Microsoft for any loss, damage or
destruction to or of any Appliance while it is at any of Customer’s locations or in the circumstances described in
Section “Responsibilities if Customer Moves the Appliance between Customer’s Locations,” with the exception of
expected wear and tear, which includes minor damage (e.g., dings and dents) that do not compromise the
structure or functionality of the Appliance. Customer is responsible for inspecting the Appliance upon receipt from
the carrier and for promptly reporting any damages to Microsoft Support at madbeops@microsoft.com. Customer
is responsible for the entire risk of loss of, or any damage (other than expected wear and tear) to, the Appliance
once it has been delivered by the carrier to Customer’s designated address until the Microsoft-designated carrier
accepts the Appliance for return delivery.
Microsoft may charge Customer a lost device fee for the Appliance (i) if the Appliance is lost or materially damaged
while it is Customer’s responsibility as described in the previous sentence, or (ii) if Customer does not return the
Appliance to the Microsoft-designated carrier for return or Microsoft pursuant to Section “Shipment and Return of
the Appliance” below, within 30 days from the end of Customer’s use of the Service. Microsoft reserves the right
to change the fee charged for lost or damaged devices, including but not limited to, by charging different amounts
for different device form factors.

133
Shipment and Return of the Appliance
Customer will be responsible for a one-time, per Appliance metered shipping fee for shipping costs and return
logistics (“Logistics Fee”), in addition to any taxes, or applicable customs fees. The Logistics Fee includes
shipping, setup, refurbishment, data destruction, and coverage for loss of the Appliance in transit. When returning
an Appliance to Microsoft, Customer agrees to package and ship the Appliance in accordance with Microsoft’s
instructions, including the use of a carrier designated by Microsoft and the packaging materials provided by
Microsoft. Customer is responsible to remove Customer’s data from the Appliance prior to returning it to Microsoft,
and follow any Microsoft issued processes for wiping or clearing the Appliance.
Disposition at End of Life
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Microsoft in its sole discretion determines that the Appliance as part of the Service
has reached or exceeded its useful lifespan while it is in the possession of Customer, then Microsoft has the right and
ability to change the Appliance or any components thereof. Customer agrees to provide Microsoft with limited access
to Customer Specified Location and the Appliance for this purpose. Microsoft will discuss logistics and timing of
activities related to this change-out of the Appliance or Appliance components with Customer.
Retention of Hardware Components Option
Microsoft may provide Customer with separate fee options to retain specified Appliance components (e.g., hard drives)
for destruction by Customer or have Microsoft dispose of said components at the end of the Term or Appliance
decommissioning.
Responsibilities if a Government Customer Moves the Appliance between Customer’s Locations
If a government Customer is using an Appliance during the Customer’s use of the Service, the government Customer
only may, at Customer’s sole risk and expense, transport the Appliance to Customer’s different locations to upload
Customer’s data in accordance with Section “Use of the Appliance and Software” above. Subject to Section ”Export
Control Laws”, Customer is responsible for obtaining at Customer’s own risk and expense any export license, import
license and other official authorization for the exportation and importation of the Appliance and associated Software
and Customer’s data to any such different location of Customers. Customer is also solely responsible for customs
clearance at any such different location of Customer’s, and Customer will bear all duties, taxes and other official
charges payable upon importation as well as any and all costs and risks of carrying out customs formalities in a timely
manner. Customer agrees to comply with and be responsible for all applicable import, export and general trade laws
and regulations should Customer decide to transport the Appliance beyond the country border in which Customer
receives the Appliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Customer transports the Appliance to a different location as
set forth in this Section, Customer agrees to cause the Appliance to return to the country location where Customer
received it initially, prior to returning the Appliance to Microsoft or a Customer Specified Location. Customer
acknowledge that there are inherent risks in shipping data on and in connection with the Appliance, and that Microsoft
will have no liability to Customer for any damage, theft, or loss occurring to an Appliance or any data stored on one,
including without limitation in transit. It is Customer’s responsibility to obtain the appropriate support agreement from
Microsoft in order to meet Customer’s operating objectives for the Appliance; however, depending on the location to
which Customer intends to move the Appliance, Microsoft’s ability to provide hardware servicing and support may be
delayed, or may not be available.
Fees
Microsoft will charge Customer specified fees in connection with Customer’s use of the Appliance as part of the
Service, with the current schedule of fees as provided by Microsoft. For clarity, Customer may use other Azure
services in connection with Customer’s use of the Service, and Microsoft deems such services as separate and
additional services subject to separate subscription or metered fees and costs, as those additional services are
installed on the Appliance. By way of example only, Azure Storage, Azure Compute, and Azure IoT Hub are separate
Azure services, and if used (even in connection with its use of the Service), separate Azure metered services will apply.
Survival
Sections Azure Services Terms, Software, Survival, Disclaimer of Warranty, Privacy Terms and Export Control Laws will
survive expiration or termination of these Additional Terms.
Disclaimer of Warranty
THE APPLIANCE AND ANY ASSISTANCE BY MICROSOFT PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THESE ADDITIONAL
TERMS IS PROVIDED “AS-IS.” CUSTOMER BEARS THE RISK OF USING THEM. MICROSOFT GIVES NO
EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER
RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER LOCAL LAWS WHICH THESE ADDITIONAL TERMS CANNOT
